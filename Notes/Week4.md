## Project Logistics
lockPattern >= 0 (should be nonnegative)

artifact has keypattern, direction has lockpattern
checking if they're equal
who checks? the action being taken is to change the lock status of the direction
the lock item is located in the direction class, so the direction class is responsible for locking and unlocking the lock
